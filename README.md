# myFlix-React-client

## Project Overview:

This is the React-based client-side of a movies application based on an already existing server-side code (REST API and database) created in an earlier project. The application gives users who register access to information about different movies, including their directors, and genres. It also allows them to update their user profile, add movies to and remove movies from a list of favorites, and delete their account.
The project uses the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), as well as Redux to handle the data flow, and React Bootstrap. It was the first client-side based on the existing server-side code. Another project with the same basic functionality was built later with the help of Angular.

## To start:

Run "npm install" to install dependencies.

## Development Server:

Run parcel [path to index.html] and navigate to "http://localhost:1234/". The app will automatically reload upon changing any of the source files.
